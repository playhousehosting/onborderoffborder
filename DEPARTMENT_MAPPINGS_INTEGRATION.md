# Department Mappings Integration - Complete

## Overview
Successfully integrated department mappings into the Workflow Management section, creating a unified automation configuration interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. WorkflowManagement.js (`src/components/workflows/WorkflowManagement.js`)
**New Features:**
- ✅ Added tab-based interface with two tabs:
  - **Lifecycle Workflows**: Existing workflow management (Joiner/Mover/Leaver)
  - **Department Mappings**: New department-to-group mapping configuration
  
**Functionality Added:**
- State management for department mappings and groups
- `loadDepartmentMappings()` - Loads mappings from localStorage
- `loadGroups()` - Fetches Azure AD groups via Graph API
- `addDepartmentMapping()` - Creates new mapping entry
- `updateDepartmentMapping()` - Updates department name or assigned groups
- `removeDepartmentMapping()` - Deletes mapping with localStorage sync
- `saveMappings()` - Persists all mappings to localStorage

**UI Components:**
- Multi-select dropdown for group assignment
- Visual badges showing selected groups with group names
- Empty state with "Add First Mapping" CTA
- Loading states with spinner animation
- Dark mode support throughout
- Responsive design with proper spacing

**Imports Added:**
```javascript
import graphService from '../../services/graphService';
import { 
  getDepartmentMappings, 
  saveDepartmentMappings 
} from '../../utils/departmentMappings';
import { BuildingOfficeIcon, UserGroupIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
```

### 2. Settings.js (`src/components/settings/Settings.js`)
**Removed:**
- ✅ "Department Mappings" tab from tab navigation
- ✅ All department mapping state variables:
  - `departmentMappings`
  - `availableGroups`
  - `isLoadingGroups`
- ✅ All department mapping functions:
  - `loadGroups()`
  - `addDepartmentMapping()`
  - `removeDepartmentMapping()`
  - `updateDepartmentMapping()`
  - `saveDepartmentMappings()`
- ✅ useEffect hook for loading groups
- ✅ useEffect hook for loading department mappings
- ✅ Entire department mappings tab content (175+ lines)
- ✅ Unused icon imports:
  - `BellIcon`
  - `UserGroupIcon`
  - `ArrowPathIcon`
  - `TrashIcon`
  - `PlusIcon`
  - `BuildingOfficeIcon`

**Result:**
- Settings component now only contains 3 tabs:
  1. Azure AD Configuration
  2. Preferences
  3. Security

### 3. README.md
**Updated:**
- ✅ Moved "Department Mappings" bullet point from "Settings & Configuration" to "Lifecycle Workflows" section
- ✅ Updated description to emphasize automation integration:
  > "Department Mappings: Map departments to groups for streamlined onboarding automation"

### 4. FAQ.js (`src/components/common/FAQ.js`)
**Updated Questions:**
1. **"What is department-to-group mapping?"**
   - Changed: `Settings → Department Mappings` → **`Workflows → Department Mappings tab`**

2. **"How does automatic group assignment work?"**
   - Added: "Manage your department mappings in the Workflows section."

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Logical Grouping**: Department mappings are now co-located with automation workflows
- **Unified Interface**: All automation configuration in one place
- **Reduced Navigation**: Users don't need to switch between Settings and Workflows
- **Cleaner Settings**: Settings page now focused on configuration, not automation

### Technical
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved
- **No Breaking Changes**: localStorage keys unchanged, backward compatible
- **Clean Separation**: Settings handles configuration, Workflows handles automation
- **Code Quality**: Removed duplicate functionality from Settings
