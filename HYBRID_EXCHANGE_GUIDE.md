# Hybrid Exchange Environment Integration Guide

## Overview

The Employee Lifecycle Portal provides full support for hybrid Exchange environments where you have both Exchange Server on-premises and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365.

## What is Hybrid Exchange?

**Hybrid Exchange** is a configuration where your organization runs:
- **Exchange Server** on-premises (in your datacenter)
- **Exchange Online** in Microsoft 365 cloud
- **Both coexisting** during migration or permanently

### Benefits of Hybrid Exchange
- Gradual migration to cloud at your own pace
- Keep specific mailboxes on-premises (compliance, size, etc.)
- Unified global address list (GAL) across both environments
- Shared calendar free/busy information
- Secure mail routing between environments
- Single management experience

## Portal Capabilities

The portal provides comprehensive hybrid Exchange management:

✅ **Automatic Mailbox Detection** - Determines if mailbox is on-prem or cloud  
✅ **Unified Management** - Single interface for both environments  
✅ **Remote Mailbox Creation** - Create cloud mailboxes for on-prem users  
✅ **Mailbox Conversion** - Convert to shared mailbox (both platforms)  
✅ **Email Forwarding** - Set forwarding rules (both platforms)  
✅ **Auto-Reply/OOF** - Configure out-of-office messages  
✅ **Mailbox Migration** - Move mailboxes from on-prem to cloud  
✅ **Migration Monitoring** - Track migration progress

## Prerequisites

### 1. Hybrid Deployment Already Configured

The Hybrid Configuration Wizard must have been run previously:
- Federation trust established
- Organization relationship configured
- Mail flow working between on-prem and cloud
- OAuth authentication configured

**Verify Hybrid Configuration:**
```powershell
Get-HybridConfiguration
Get-FederationTrust
Get-OrganizationRelationship
```

### 2. Exchange Server Requirements

- **Version**: Exchange 2013 or later (2016/2019 recommended)
- **Updates**: Latest Cumulative Update installed
- **Management Shell**: Exchange Management Shell available
- **PowerShell Remoting**: Enabled on Exchange Server

**Enable PowerShell Remoting:**
```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.Exchange -ShowSecurityDescriptorUI
```

### 3. Service Account Setup

Create a dedicated service account with Exchange permissions:

```powershell
# Create service account
New-ADUser -Name "svc_exchange_portal" `
  -UserPrincipalName "svc_exchange@yourdomain.com" `
  -AccountPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Enter password") `
  -Enabled $true `
  -PasswordNeverExpires $true `
  -CannotChangePassword $true

# Add to Exchange Organization Management
Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity "Organization Management" `
  -Member "svc_exchange_portal"

# Grant PowerShell remoting access
Set-User -Identity "svc_exchange_portal" -RemotePowerShellEnabled $true
```

**Required Permissions:**
- Organization Management role group (or specific roles):
  - Mail Recipients
  - Mail Recipient Creation
  - Mailbox Import Export (for PST operations)
  - Move Mailboxes (for migrations)

### 4. Network Connectivity

**From Backend to Exchange Server:**
- Port 5985 (HTTP) or 5986 (HTTPS) for WinRM
- DNS resolution of Exchange Server hostname
- Firewall rules allowing PowerShell remoting

**Test Connectivity:**
```powershell
Test-WSMan -ComputerName exchange01.yourdomain.com
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName exchange01.yourdomain.com -Port 5985
```

### 5. Azure AD Connect

- Already installed and actively syncing
- Mailbox attributes synchronizing correctly
- No sync errors or conflicts
- Target OU included in sync scope

**Verify Sync:**
```powershell
Get-ADSyncScheduler | Select-Object LastSyncTime, NextSyncCyclePolicyType
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta  # Force sync if needed
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project environment variables:

```bash
# Exchange Server hostname or FQDN
EXCHANGE_SERVER=exchange01.yourdomain.com

# Service account with Exchange Organization Management permissions
EXCHANGE_USERNAME=svc_exchange_portal
EXCHANGE_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123!

# Domain for Exchange authentication
EXCHANGE_DOMAIN=YOURDOMAIN

# Remote routing domain for Exchange Online
# Your .onmicrosoft.com domain
EXCHANGE_REMOTE_DOMAIN=contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com
```

**Security Note:** Vercel encrypts environment variables at rest. Rotate passwords quarterly.

### Finding Your Remote Domain

```powershell
# On Exchange Server
Get-RemoteMailbox | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty RemoteRoutingAddress
# Result: user@contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com
# EXCHANGE_REMOTE_DOMAIN=contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com
```

## Understanding Mailbox Types

### On-Premises Mailbox
- Physical mailbox on Exchange Server in your datacenter
- User object in on-premises Active Directory
- Managed via Exchange Management Shell
- Mail flows through your Exchange servers
- **Use for:** Large mailboxes (>100GB), compliance requirements, VIPs

**Example:**
```
User: john.doe@domain.com
Mailbox Location: Exchange Server (EXCH01\Database01)
Management: PowerShell Remoting → Exchange Server
```

### Remote Mailbox
- Cloud mailbox (Exchange Online) for on-prem user
- User account still in on-premises Active Directory
- Synced to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect
- Mailbox hosted in Microsoft 365
- **Use for:** Standard users, post-migration state

**Example:**
```
User: jane.smith@domain.com (on-prem AD)
Mailbox Location: Exchange Online
Routing Address: jane.smith@contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com
Management: Graph API → Exchange Online
```

### Cloud-Only Mailbox
- User and mailbox both in Azure AD/Exchange Online
- Never existed on-premises
- Managed entirely through Graph API
- **Use for:** New hires in cloud-first organizations

**Example:**
```
User: bob.jones@domain.com (Azure AD only)
Mailbox Location: Exchange Online
Management: Graph API → Exchange Online
```

## Portal Operations

### 1. Mailbox Detection

The portal automatically determines mailbox type:

```javascript
GET /api/exchange/mailbox-type/user@domain.com

Response:
{
  "Type": "OnPremises",
  "RecipientTypeDetails": "UserMailbox",
  "Database": "EXCH01\\Database01",
  "ManageInExchange": true,
  "ManageInGraphAPI": false
}
```

OR

```javascript
Response:
{
  "Type": "Remote",
  "RecipientTypeDetails": "RemoteUserMailbox",
  "RemoteRoutingAddress": "user@contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com",
  "ManageInExchange": false,
  "ManageInGraphAPI": true
}
```

### 2. Creating Remote Mailboxes

For new hires who should have cloud mailboxes:

```javascript
POST /api/exchange/create-remote-mailbox
{
  "userPrincipalName": "newuser@domain.com",
  "alias": "newuser"
}

Response:
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "Remote mailbox created successfully",
  "PrimarySmtpAddress": "newuser@domain.com",
  "RemoteRoutingAddress": "newuser@contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com"
}
```

**Behind the Scenes:**
```powershell
Enable-RemoteMailbox -Identity newuser@domain.com `
  -RemoteRoutingAddress newuser@contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com
```

### 3. Converting to Shared Mailbox

#### On-Premises Mailbox:
```javascript
POST /api/exchange/convert-to-shared
{
  "identity": "user@domain.com"
}

Response:
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "On-premises mailbox converted to shared",
  "Type": "OnPremises"
}
```

#### Remote Mailbox:
```javascript
Response:
{
  "Success": false,
  "Message": "This is a remote mailbox. Use Graph API to convert in Exchange Online.",
  "Type": "Remote",
  "UseGraphAPI": true
}
```

Portal automatically uses Graph API for remote mailboxes.

### 4. Setting Email Forwarding

#### On-Premises:
```javascript
POST /api/exchange/set-forwarding
{
  "identity": "user@domain.com",
  "forwardingAddress": "manager@domain.com",
  "deliverToMailboxAndForward": true
}
```

#### Remote:
Uses Graph API automatically for remote mailboxes.

### 5. Setting Auto-Reply (Out of Office)

```javascript
POST /api/exchange/set-auto-reply
{
  "identity": "user@domain.com",
  "enabled": true,
  "internalMessage": "I am out of office...",
  "externalMessage": "Thank you for your email...",
  "externalAudience": "All"
}
```

Works for both on-prem and remote mailboxes (portal routes appropriately).

### 6. Migrating Mailboxes to Cloud

Start a mailbox move from on-premises to Exchange Online:

```javascript
POST /api/exchange/move-to-cloud
{
  "identity": "user@domain.com",
  "targetDeliveryDomain": "contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com",
  "badItemLimit": 10
}

Response:
{
  "Success": true,
  "Message": "Mailbox move request created successfully",
  "Identity": "user@domain.com",
  "Status": "Queued"
}
```

**Monitor Progress:**
```javascript
GET /api/exchange/move-request/user@domain.com

Response:
{
  "Success": true,
  "Status": "InProgress",
  "PercentComplete": 45,
  "BytesTransferred": "2.3 GB",
  "ItemsTransferred": 8524,
  "Message": "Syncing mailbox data..."
}
```

**Migration Stages:**
1. **Queued** - Request created, waiting to start
2. **InProgress** - Initial sync of data (can take hours/days)
3. **AutoSuspended** - Initial sync complete, waiting for final cutover
4. **Completing** - Final incremental sync (brief disruption)
5. **Completed** - Mailbox now in Exchange Online

**Migration Timeline:**
- Small mailbox (<5GB): 2-4 hours
- Medium mailbox (5-20GB): 4-9 hours
- Large mailbox (20-50GB): 9-26 hours
- Very large mailbox (>50GB): 1-7 days

## Onboarding Workflow

### Scenario 1: New Hire with Cloud Mailbox

```
1. Create user in on-prem AD
   └─> POST /api/ad/create-user

2. Wait for Azure AD Connect sync
   └─> 30 minutes

3. Create remote mailbox
   └─> POST /api/exchange/create-remote-mailbox

4. Assign M365 license
   └─> Graph API

5. Mailbox ready in Exchange Online
   └─> 5-10 minutes provisioning
```

**Total Time:** 35-40 minutes

### Scenario 2: New Hire with On-Prem Mailbox

```
1. Create user in on-prem AD
   └─> POST /api/ad/create-user

2. Create on-prem mailbox
   └─> New-Mailbox cmdlet

3. Mailbox ready immediately
   └─> Can send/receive email
```

**Total Time:** < 5 minutes

## Offboarding Workflow

### Automatic Routing

The portal's offboarding wizard automatically:
1. Detects mailbox type (on-prem vs remote)
2. Routes operations to appropriate platform
3. Handles mixed scenarios (user in AD, mailbox in cloud)

### On-Premises Mailbox Offboarding

```
Disable Account → AD PowerShell
Convert to Shared → Exchange PowerShell
Set Forwarding → Exchange PowerShell
Set Auto-Reply → Exchange PowerShell
```

### Remote Mailbox Offboarding

```
Disable Account → Graph API
Convert to Shared → Graph API
Set Forwarding → Graph API
Set Auto-Reply → Graph API
Revoke Licenses → Graph API
```

### Visual Indicators

The portal shows mailbox location:
- 🏢 On-Premises Mailbox
- ☁️ Cloud Mailbox (Remote/Cloud-Only)

## Migration Best Practices

### 1. Planning

**Assessment:**
- Inventory all mailboxes and sizes
- Identify mailboxes that must stay on-prem
- Determine migration waves (by department, size, etc.)
- Set realistic timeline (don't rush large mailboxes)

**Priorities:**
- Test with IT department first (10-20 users)
- Then standard users in waves
- VIPs last (lowest risk once process proven)

### 2. Execution

**Pilot Phase:**
- Migrate 10-20 IT users
- Test all functionality
- Identify and resolve issues
- Document lessons learned

**Production Waves:**
- 50-100 users per week typical
- Schedule migrations during off-hours
- Monitor progress daily
- Have help desk ready for issues

**Commands:**
```powershell
# Start migration wave
$Users = Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Sales,DC=domain,DC=com"
$Users | ForEach-Object {
    New-MoveRequest -Identity $_.PrimarySmtpAddress `
        -Remote `
        -RemoteHostName outlook.office365.com `
        -TargetDeliveryDomain contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com `
        -BatchName "Sales_Wave1"
}

# Monitor progress
Get-MoveRequest -BatchName "Sales_Wave1" | Get-MoveRequestStatistics | 
    Select-Object DisplayName, Status, PercentComplete, BytesTransferred
```

### 3. Post-Migration

**Verification:**
- Test mailbox access in Outlook
- Check all folders present
- Test calendar free/busy
- Verify mobile devices reconnect

**Cleanup:**
- Remove on-prem mailbox after 30 days
- Update documentation
- Archive migration logs
- Review success metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot Connect to Exchange Server

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to connect to Exchange Server"
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify WinRM enabled: `Test-WSMan exchange01.domain.com`
2. Check firewall allows port 5985/5986
3. Test service account credentials
4. Verify service account has PowerShell remoting enabled
5. Check Exchange server is online

**Test Connection:**
```powershell
$Cred = Get-Credential DOMAIN\svc_exchange
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange `
    -ConnectionUri http://exchange01.domain.com/PowerShell `
    -Credential $Cred
Get-PSSession
```

### Issue: Mailbox Not Found

**Symptoms:**
- "Mailbox not found" error
- "Object couldn't be found"

**Solutions:**
1. Check user is synced to Azure AD (if remote mailbox)
2. Force Azure AD Connect sync: `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta`
3. Verify user exists in on-prem AD
4. Check mailbox type: `Get-Mailbox` vs `Get-RemoteMailbox`
5. Use correct identity format (UPN: user@domain.com)

### Issue: Access Denied

**Symptoms:**
- "Access is denied"
- "Insufficient permissions"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify service account in Organization Management role group
2. Check PowerShell remoting permissions
3. Confirm service account can access Exchange server
4. Review Exchange RBAC assignments

**Verify Permissions:**
```powershell
Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee "svc_exchange_portal"
Get-User "svc_exchange_portal" | Select-Object RemotePowerShellEnabled
```

### Issue: Move Request Failed

**Symptoms:**
- Migration stuck or failed
- "BadItemLimitExceeded" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check move request details: `Get-MoveRequestStatistics -IncludeReport`
2. Increase BadItemLimit if corruption found
3. Resume suspended move: `Resume-MoveRequest`
4. Check Exchange Online quota available
5. Verify network connectivity stable

**Diagnose Failed Move:**
```powershell
Get-MoveRequest -Identity user@domain.com | Get-MoveRequestStatistics -IncludeReport | 
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Report | Out-File C:\MoveReport.txt
```

### Issue: Hybrid Configuration Broken

**Symptoms:**
- Free/busy not working
- Mail flow issues
- Federation errors

**Solutions:**
1. Run Hybrid Configuration Wizard again
2. Verify federation trust: `Test-FederationTrust`
3. Check organization relationship: `Get-OrganizationRelationship`
4. Test free/busy: `Test-FederationTrust -UserIdentity user@domain.com`

**Health Check:**
```powershell
# Test hybrid connectivity
Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeRemoteMove `
    -Autodiscover -EmailAddress user@domain.com

# Verify federation
Get-FederationInformation -DomainName domain.com
Test-FederationTrust -UserIdentity user@domain.com
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Service Account Security

- Use dedicated account (don't share with other services)
- Strong password (16+ characters)
- Rotate password quarterly
- Restrict to Exchange management only
- Enable account auditing
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 2. Network Security

- Use HTTPS (port 5986) instead of HTTP (5985)
- Restrict PowerShell remoting to specific IPs
- Use firewall rules to limit exposure
- Consider VPN or ExpressRoute for production
- Enable TLS 1.2 minimum

### 3. Audit Logging

Enable comprehensive logging:
```powershell
# Enable admin audit logging
Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -AdminAuditLogEnabled $true -AdminAuditLogAgeLimit 90.00:00:00

# Enable mailbox audit logging
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true
```

Review logs regularly for unauthorized changes.

### 4. Least Privilege

Grant only necessary permissions:
- Use specific role assignments instead of Organization Management
- Separate service accounts for different functions
- Regular permission audits
- Remove unused accounts

## Performance Optimization

### 1. PowerShell Session Reuse

Reuse PowerShell sessions instead of creating new connections for every operation:
- Keep session alive for batch operations
- Close sessions when done to free resources
- Handle session failures gracefully

### 2. Batch Operations

Process multiple users in batches:
- Migrate 10-20 mailboxes simultaneously
- Don't overwhelm Exchange server
- Monitor resource usage

### 3. Caching

Cache mailbox type detection:
- Cache for 5-10 minutes
- Invalidate on user operations
- Reduces unnecessary queries

### 4. Async Operations

Use async for long-running tasks:
- Mailbox migrations
- Large data exports
- Bulk operations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks

- Azure AD Connect sync status
- Move request progress
- Service account health
- Error logs review

### Weekly Tasks

- Mailbox count (on-prem vs cloud)
- Migration success rate
- Performance metrics
- Cleanup completed move requests

### Monthly Reviews

- Permission audit
- Password rotation (quarterly)
- License utilization
- User feedback assessment
- Documentation updates

## Cost Considerations

### Exchange Server Costs

- Hardware/VM costs
- Windows Server licenses
- Exchange Server licenses (per user)
- Maintenance and support
- Power and cooling

### Exchange Online Costs

- M365 E1: $8/user/month (50GB mailbox)
- M365 E3: $20/user/month (100GB mailbox)
- M365 E5: $35/user/month (100GB mailbox)
- Shared mailboxes: FREE (up to 50GB)

### Migration Costs

- Network bandwidth during migration
- Temporary dual licensing
- Staff time for management
- Third-party tools (if used)

**Savings from Cloud Migration:**
- Reduced on-prem infrastructure
- No Exchange server maintenance
- Automatic updates and patches
- Better disaster recovery
- Scalability without hardware
