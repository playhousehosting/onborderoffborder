# On-Premises Active Directory Integration - Implementation Summary

## üéâ What Was Built

You can now create new employees in your **on-premises Active Directory** through the portal. Users automatically sync to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect within 30 minutes, enabling a true hybrid identity experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Portal UI (React)
    ‚Üì
Backend API (/api/ad/create-user)
    ‚Üì
PowerShell Remoting (WinRM)
    ‚Üì
Domain Controller (On-Prem AD)
    ‚Üì
Azure AD Connect (Sync Engine)
    ‚Üì
Azure AD (Cloud)
    ‚Üì
Microsoft 365 Services
```

## üì¶ What Was Added

### Backend Components

1. **`backend/routes/ad.js`** - New route handler with endpoints:
   - `POST /api/ad/create-user` - Create user in on-prem AD
   - `GET /api/ad/config-status` - Check if integration is configured
   - `POST /api/ad/test-connection` - Test AD server connectivity
   - `GET /api/ad/check-user/:samAccountName` - Verify user exists

2. **PowerShell Integration**
   - Secure remote script execution via WinRM
   - Base64-encoded script transmission
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - JSON output parsing

3. **Environment Variables** (in `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   AD_SERVER=dc01.yourdomain.com
   AD_USERNAME=svc_portal
   AD_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123!
   AD_DOMAIN=YOURDOMAIN
   AD_DEFAULT_OU=OU=Users,DC=yourdomain,DC=com
   AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=TempPass123!
   ```

### Frontend Components

4. **`OnboardingWizard.js` Updates**:
   - Added `createInOnPremAD` toggle checkbox
   - AD configuration status check on load
   - Conditional UI based on AD availability
   - Enhanced user creation flow for on-prem users
   - Informational banners explaining sync process

5. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Visual indicator when AD integration is available
   - Clear messaging about 30-minute sync wait
   - Automatic detection of AD server configuration
   - Graceful degradation if AD not configured

### Documentation

6. **`ON_PREM_AD_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide covering:
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Step-by-step configuration
   - Security best practices
   - Troubleshooting common issues
   - Production deployment checklist

7. **`ON_PREM_AD_QUICK_START.md`** - Quick reference for:
   - One-time admin setup
   - User workflow for creating employees
   - Common troubleshooting tips

## üîê Security Features

- **Service Account with Minimal Permissions**: Dedicated account limited to user creation in specific OUs
- **Encrypted Password Storage**: Credentials stored in Vercel environment variables
- **PowerShell Injection Prevention**: All inputs escaped before script execution
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged for compliance
- **Network Isolation**: Supports WinRM over HTTPS for encrypted transport

## ‚úÖ Capabilities

### What Works Now
- ‚úÖ Create users in on-premises Active Directory
- ‚úÖ Set all standard user attributes (name, email, department, title, phone, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Set temporary passwords with force-change-on-login
- ‚úÖ Enable/disable accounts
- ‚úÖ Assign to specific OUs
- ‚úÖ Set manager relationships
- ‚úÖ Automatic sync to Azure AD (via existing Azure AD Connect)

### What Happens After Sync
Once the user syncs to Azure AD (30 minutes), portal can:
- Assign Microsoft 365 licenses
- Add to Azure AD groups
- Configure email/mailbox
- Send welcome emails
- Schedule training

## üöß Limitations

1. **Sync Delay**: Users don't appear in Azure AD immediately (30 min typical)
2. **No Direct Azure AD Operations**: Can't assign licenses until sync completes
3. **Requires Azure AD Connect**: Organization must have existing sync infrastructure
4. **Network Dependency**: Backend must reach Domain Controller via WinRM
5. **Windows Only**: PowerShell remoting requires Windows Server Domain Controller

## üìã Setup Requirements

### Administrator Must Configure:

1. **Azure AD Connect**: Already installed and syncing
2. **PowerShell Remoting**: Enabled on Domain Controller
3. **Service Account**: Created with user creation permissions
4. **Network Access**: Backend can reach DC on port 5985/5986
5. **Environment Variables**: Set in Vercel backend configuration

### Typical Setup Time: 30-60 minutes

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before production use:

- [ ] Test connection endpoint returns success
- [ ] Create test user in non-production OU
- [ ] Verify user appears in on-prem AD with correct attributes
- [ ] Force sync via Azure AD Connect
- [ ] Confirm user syncs to Azure AD with `onPremisesSyncEnabled = true`
- [ ] Verify password works for cloud and on-prem login
- [ ] Test permission restrictions (service account can't create outside OU)
- [ ] Verify audit logs capture user creation activities

## üìä Monitoring

### Health Checks

**AD Integration Status:**
```bash
GET /api/ad/config-status
```

**Connection Test:**
```bash
POST /api/ad/test-connection
```

### What to Monitor

- Failed authentication attempts (service account)
- User creation success/failure rates
- Sync delays (Azure AD Connect health)
- PowerShell execution errors
- Network connectivity issues

## üîÑ Workflow Comparison

### Before (Cloud Only)
1. Create user in Azure AD directly
2. User available immediately
3. Assign licenses/groups right away

### After (Hybrid with On-Prem)
1. Create user in on-premises AD ‚ú® NEW
2. Wait 30 minutes for sync ‚è±Ô∏è
3. User appears in Azure AD (synced)
4. Assign licenses/groups in cloud

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
- Single source of truth (on-prem AD)
- Users work with both cloud and on-prem resources
- Consistent with existing IT infrastructure
- Preserves investment in on-prem identity management

## üéØ Use Cases

### Perfect For Organizations That:
- Have existing on-premises Active Directory
- Use Azure AD Connect for hybrid identity
- Need users to access both cloud and on-prem resources
- Want centralized identity management in AD
- Have compliance requirements for on-prem password storage

### Not Suitable For:
- Cloud-only organizations (no on-prem AD)
- Organizations without Azure AD Connect
- Scenarios requiring immediate Azure AD access
- Backend environments that can't reach on-prem network

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review setup documentation** - [ON_PREM_AD_SETUP.md](./ON_PREM_AD_SETUP.md)
2. **Configure environment** - Set AD_* variables in Vercel
3. **Test connection** - Use `/api/ad/test-connection` endpoint
4. **Create test user** - Use non-production OU first
5. **Monitor sync** - Verify user appears in Azure AD
6. **Deploy to production** - Update production environment variables

## üí° Tips

- **Start with testing**: Use a dedicated testing OU before production
- **Document your OU structure**: Keep track of which OUs sync to Azure AD
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Service account password should be changed periodically
- **Monitor sync health**: Set up alerts for Azure AD Connect sync failures
- **Communicate sync delay**: Let teams know about 30-minute wait for cloud access
