## 🚀 Test in Browser (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Your App
Go to your deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

### Step 2: Clear Browser Storage
```javascript
// Paste in DevTools Console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Step 3: Enter Credentials
Fill in the Configuration Form:
- **Tenant ID**: `0851dcc0-890e-4381-b82d-c14fe2915be3`
- **Client ID**: `3f4637ee-e352-4273-96a6-3996a4a7f8c0`
- **Client Secret**: `iUn8Q~*PZYvYamlGroHINt-jxFAMl6h*~1hCnbF8`

### Step 4: Click "Save & Login"

### Step 5: Watch Console (F12 → Console)

#### ✅ GOOD SIGNS (New Fix Works):
```
✅ App-Only authentication complete, notifying AuthContext...
📡 Dispatching demoModeLogin event
📡 AuthContext received demoModeLogin event
✅ AuthContext: Setting authenticated user: Application Admin
✅ Auth state updated in context, dispatching authStateUpdated
✅ Auth state updated in context, navigating to dashboard
🔒 ProtectedRoute check - isAuthenticated: true, loading: false, user: Application Admin
✅ ProtectedRoute: Access granted
[Dashboard renders]
```

#### ❌ BAD SIGNS (Old Bug Still There):
```
Timeout: Navigating to dashboard anyway
🔒 ProtectedRoute check - isAuthenticated: false, loading: false, user: none
🚫 ProtectedRoute: Not authenticated, redirecting to login
```

### Step 6: Expected Result
- ✅ Dashboard appears immediately
- ✅ User name shows "Application Admin"
- ✅ Menu items visible and clickable
- ✅ No errors in console
- ✅ No redirect back to login

## 🔍 What to Check

### Console Verification
```javascript
// Open DevTools and paste this to see the full flow:
console.log('🔍 Auth State Sync Test Started');
console.log('Click "Save & Login" and watch console above');
```

Look for these exact messages in order:
1. ✅ "App-Only authentication complete"
2. ✅ "Dispatching demoModeLogin event"
3. ✅ "AuthContext received demoModeLogin event"
4. ✅ "Setting authenticated user"
5. ✅ "Auth state updated in context, dispatching authStateUpdated" (NOT "Timeout")
6. ✅ "Auth state updated in context, navigating to dashboard"
7. ✅ "ProtectedRoute: Access granted"

### Network Tab
Go to DevTools → Network tab:
- Look for manifest.json → should show **200 OK** (not 401)
- Look for any red failed requests → should be NONE

### Application Tab
Go to DevTools → Application → Local Storage:
- Look for `azureConfig` → should have your credentials
- Look for `demoUser` → should have user data
- Look for `demoMode` → should be "true"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing "Timeout: Navigating to dashboard anyway"

**This means**: Vercel hasn't updated yet. 

**Solutions:**
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Disable cache**: F12 → Settings → Check "Disable cache"
3. **Clear cookies**: F12 → Application → Cookies → Delete all
4. **Wait**: Give Vercel 5 minutes to deploy new version
5. **Check Vercel**: Go to Vercel dashboard → Is deployment "Ready"?

### Problem: Still seeing "isAuthenticated: false, redirecting to login"

**This means**: Old code is still running.

**Solutions:**
1. Close all tabs and browser
2. Clear entire browser cache
3. Restart browser
4. Try incognito/private window
5. Try different browser

### Problem: Credentials not saving

**This means**: Form validation failing.

**Check:**
1. All three fields filled?
2. No leading/trailing spaces?
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Try copy-pasting exact values
