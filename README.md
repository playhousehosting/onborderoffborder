## Security Considerations

- The application uses delegated permissions with user context
- Sensitive operations require confirmation
- All operations are logged in Microsoft 365 audit logs
- Users must have appropriate permissions in Azure AD
- Consider implementing additional logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Consent not granted for this application"**
   - Ensure an admin has granted consent for the API permissions
   - Check that all required permissions are added to the app registration

2. **"Access denied" errors**
   - Verify the signed-in user has the necessary directory roles
   - Check that the app registration has the correct permissions

3. **"Device management features not available"**
   - Ensure Intune is properly configured in your tenant
   - Verify the user has Intune administrator permissions

4. **Authentication redirects not working**
   - Check that the redirect URI in your app registration matches exactly
   - Ensure the authentication configuration is correct

### Debug Tips

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify the network requests in browser dev tools
- Check the Azure AD sign-in logs for authentication issues

## Development

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Customization

- Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize the design system
- Update `src/config/authConfig.js` to change authentication settings
- Extend `src/services/graphService.js` to add additional Graph API operations
